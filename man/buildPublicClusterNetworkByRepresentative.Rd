    Build Global Network of Public TCR/BCR Clusters Using Representative Clones
}
\description{
Alternative step in the workflow
\href{https://mlizhangx.github.io/Network-Analysis-for-Repertoire-Sequencing-/articles/public_clusters.html}{Searching for Public TCR/BCR Clusters}.
Intended for use following \code{\link[=findPublicClusters]{findPublicClusters()}}
in cases where
\code{\link[=buildPublicClusterNetwork]{buildPublicClusterNetwork()}}
cannot be practically used due to the size of the full global network.

Given cluster-level metadata for each sample's filtered clusters, selects a
representative TCR/BCR from each cluster, combines the representatives into a
global network and performs network analysis and cluster analysis.

\details{
From each filtered cluster in each sample's network, a representative TCR/BCR
is selected. By default, this is the sequence with the greatest clone count in
each cluster. The representatives from all clusters and all samples are then
used to construct a single global network. Cluster analysis is used to partition
this global network into clusters. Network properties for the nodes and clusters
are computed and returned as metadata. A plot of the global network graph is
produced, with the nodes colored according to sample ID.

Within this network, clusters containing nodes from multiple samples can be
considered as the skeletons of the complete public clusters. The filtered cluster
data for each sample can then be subset to keep the sample-level clusters whose
representative TCR/BCRs belong to the skeletons of the public clusters. After
subsetting in this manner,
\code{\link[=buildPublicClusterNetwork]{buildPublicClusterNetwork()}} can be used
to construct the global network of complete public clusters.

\value{
    If the input data contains a combined total of fewer than two rows, or if the
    global network contains no nodes, then the function returns \code{NULL},
    invisibly, with a warning. Otherwise, invisibly returns
    a list of network objects as returned by
    \code{\link[=buildRepSeqNetwork]{buildRepSeqNetwork()}}.
    The global cluster membership variable in the data frame \code{node_data}
    is named \code{ClusterIDPublic}.

    The data frame \code{cluster_data} includes the following variables that
    represent properties of the clusters in the global network of representative
    TCR/BCRs:
\item{cluster_id}{
    The global cluster ID number.}
\item{node_count}{
    The number of global network nodes in the global cluster.}
\item{TotalSampleLevelNodes}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the number
    of nodes in the sample-level cluster for which it is the representative TCR/BCR.
    We then sum these node counts across all the representative TCR/BCRs in the
    global cluster.}
\item{TotalCloneCount}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the
    aggregate clone count from all nodes in the sample-level cluster for which
    it is the representative TCR/BCR. We then sum these aggregate clone counts
    across all the representative TCR/BCRs in the global cluster.}
\item{MeanOfMeanSeqLength}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the mean
    sequence length over all clones (nodes) in the sample-level cluster for which
    it is the representative TCR/BCR. We then average these mean sequence lengths
    over all the representative TCR/BCRs in the global cluster.}
\item{MeanDegreeInPublicNet}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the mean
    network degree over all nodes in the sample-level cluster for which it is the
    representative TCR/BCR. We then average these mean degree values over all the
    representative TCR/BCRs in the global cluster.}
\item{MaxDegreeInPublicNet}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the maximum
    network degree across all nodes in the sample-level cluster for which it is
    the representative TCR/BCR. We then take the maximum of these maximum degree
    values over all the representative TCR/BCRs in the global cluster.}
\item{SeqWithMaxDegree}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the maximum
    network degree across all nodes in the sample-level cluster for which it is
    the representative TCR/BCR. We then identify the representative TCR/BCR with
    the maximum value of these maximum degrees over all the representative TCR/BCRs
    in the global cluster. The TCR/BCR sequence of the identified representative
    TCR/BCR is recorded in this variable.}
\item{MaxCloneCount}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the maximum
    clone count across all clones (nodes) in the sample-level cluster for which
    it is the representative TCR/BCR. We then take the maximum of these maximum
    clone counts over all the representative TCR/BCRs in the global cluster.}
\item{SampleWithMaxCloneCount}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the maximum
    clone count across all clones (nodes) in the sample-level cluster for which
    it is the representative TCR/BCR. We then identify the representative TCR/BCR
    with the maximum value of these maximum clone counts over all the representative
    TCR/BCRs in the global cluster. The sample to which the identified representative
    TCR/BCR belongs is recorded in this variable.}
\item{SeqWithMaxCloneCount}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the maximum
    clone count across all clones (nodes) in the sample-level cluster for which it
    is the representative TCR/BCR. We then identify the representative TCR/BCR with
    the maximum value of these maximum clone counts over all the representative
    TCR/BCRs in the global cluster. The TCR/BCR sequence of the identified
    representative TCR/BCR is recorded in this variable.}
\item{MaxAggCloneCount}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the
    aggregate clone count across all clones (nodes) in the sample-level cluster
    for which it is the representative TCR/BCR. We then take the maximum of these
    aggregate clone counts over all the representative TCR/BCRs in the global
    cluster.}
\item{SampleWithMaxAggCloneCount}{
    For each representative TCR/BCR in the global cluster, we record the
    aggregate clone count across all clones (nodes) in the sample-level cluster
    for which it is the representative TCR/BCR. We then identify the representative
    TCR/BCR with the maximum value of these aggregate clone counts over all the
    representative TCR/BCRs in the global cluster. The sample to which the
    identified representative TCR/BCR belongs is recorded in this variable.}
