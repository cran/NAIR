    Aggregate Counts/Frequencies for Clones With Identical Receptor Sequences
}
\description{
    Given bulk Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire Sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data
    with clones indexed by row, returns a data frame containing one row for each
    unique receptor sequence. Includes the number of clones sharing each sequence,
    as well as aggregate values for clone count and clone frequency across all
    clones sharing each sequence. Clones can be grouped according to metadata,
    in which case aggregation is performed within (but not across) groups.
}
\usage{
aggregateIdenticalClones(
  data,
  clone_col,
  count_col,
  freq_col,
  grouping_cols = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
      A data frame containing the bulk AIRR-Seq data, with clones indexed by row.
}
  \item{clone_col}{
      Specifies the column of \code{data} containing
      the receptor sequences.
      Accepts a character string containing the column name
      or a numeric scalar containing the column index.
}
  \item{count_col}{
      Specifies the column of \code{data} containing
      the clone counts.
      Accepts a character string containing the column name
      or a numeric scalar containing the column index.
}
  \item{freq_col}{
      Specifies the column of \code{data} containing
      the clone frequencies.
      Accepts a character string containing the column name
      or a numeric scalar containing the column index.
}
  \item{grouping_cols}{
      An optional character vector of column names
      or numeric vector of column indices, specifying
      one or more columns of \code{data} used to assign clones to groups.
      If provided, aggregation occurs within groups, but not across groups.
      See details.
}
  \item{verbose}{
      Logical. If \code{TRUE}, generates messages about the tasks
      performed and their progress, as well as relevant properties of intermediate
      outputs. Messages are sent to \code{\link[=stderr]{stderr()}}.
  }
}
\details{
  If \code{grouping_cols} is left unspecified, the returned data frame will contain
  one row for each unique receptor sequence appearing in \code{data}.

  If one or more columns of \code{data} are specified using the \code{grouping_cols}
  argument, then each clone (row) in \code{data} is assigned to a group based on its
  combination of values in these columns. If two clones share the same receptor sequence
  but belong to different groups, their receptor sequence will appear multiple times
  in the returned data frame, with one row for each group in which the sequence appears.
  In each such row, the aggregate clone count, aggregate clone frequency, and number of
  clones sharing the sequence are reported within the group for that row.
}
\value{
    A data frame whose first column contains the receptor sequences and has the
    same name as the column of \code{data} specified by \code{clone_col}. One
    additional column will be present for each column of \code{data} that is
    specified using the \code{grouping_cols} argument, with each having the same
    column name. The remaining columns are as follows:

    \item{AggregatedCloneCount}{The aggregate clone count across all clones (within
    the same group, if applicable) that share the receptor sequence in that row.
    }

    \item{AggregatedCloneFrequency}{The aggregate clone frequency across all clones
    (within the same group, if applicable) that share the receptor sequence in that row.
    }

    \item{UniqueCloneCount}{The number of clones (rows) in \code{data} (within the
    same group, if applicable) possessing the receptor sequence for the current row.
    }
