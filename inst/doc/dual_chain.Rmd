For single-cell data, cell-level network analysis can be performed based on joint similarity in alpha chain sequence and beta chain sequence.

We simulate some toy data to demonstrate the usage.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
library(NAIR)

dat <- simulateToyData(chains = 2)
head(dat)
```

The input data is assumed to have the following format:

* Each row corresponds to a unique cell
* The data contains separate columns for alpha chain sequence and beta chain sequence

Dual-chain network analysis can be performed using `buildRepSeqNetwork()` (or `generateNetworkObjects()`) by supplying a length-2 vector to the `seq_col` parameter:

* First entry should reference the column for alpha chain sequence
* Second entry should reference the column for beta chain sequence

```{r}
# Build network based on joint dual-chain similarity
network <- buildNet(dat, 
                    seq_col = c("AlphaSeq", "BetaSeq"),
                    count_col = "UMIs",
                    node_stats = TRUE, 
                    stats_to_include = "all",
                    cluster_stats = TRUE, 
                    color_nodes_by = "SampleID",
                    size_nodes_by = "UMIs",
                    node_size_limits = c(0.5, 3)
)
```

We print the network graph plot with labels added for the largest two clusters:

```{r}
addClusterLabels(network$plots$SampleID, network, top_n_clusters = 2, size = 8)
```

The list returned `buildRepSeqNetwork()` the following items:

```{r}
names(network)
```

Notice that the list contains three adjacency matrices: `adjacency_matrix` corresponds to the network based on joint similarity in both chain sequences, while `adj_mat_a` corresponds to the network based only on similarity in the alpha-chain sequence (and similarly for `adj_mat_b`). 


The cluster-level data contains sequence-based cluster statistics for each of the alpha and beta chain sequences:

```{r}
head(network$cluster_data)
```


The remainder of the output and customization follows the [general case for  `buildRepSeqNetwork()`](buildRepSeqNetwork.html).
